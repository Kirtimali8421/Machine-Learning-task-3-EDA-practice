# Machine-Learning-task-3-EDA-practice
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
This notebook is part of the data science pipeline and focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset. EDA is a critical step in any machine learning or data analysis project, as it helps uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using statistical summaries and visualizations.

ðŸ“‚ Contents of the Notebook:
Importing Libraries
Used essential Python libraries such as:

pandas for data manipulation

numpy for numerical operations

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

Loading the Dataset
The dataset is read into a DataFrame using pandas. Initial inspection is performed to understand its structure using:

head(), info(), describe(), shape, etc.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values using methods like dropna() or fillna()

Removed duplicate records (if any)

Renamed columns for better readability (if required)

Univariate Analysis

Distribution of individual variables

Visualizations: histograms, bar plots, value counts

Bivariate Analysis

Relationships between features using:

Scatter plots

Correlation matrix and heatmap

Pair plots for visual exploration

Descriptive Statistics

Calculated measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation

Identified outliers using box plots and IQR

Initial Observations

Noted key patterns, unusual points, and potential areas of focus for further analysis or feature engineering

âœ… Purpose

This EDA task provides an essential foundation for:

Understanding the dataset structure and variables

Identifying data quality issues

Preparing data for machine learning models
